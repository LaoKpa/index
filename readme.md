# Index project
This project initially aimed to reproduce result of this article by Sebastian Heinz:
"A simple deep learning model for stock price prediction using TensorFlow"
(https://medium.com/mlreview/a-simple-deep-learning-model-for-stock-price-prediction-using-tensorflow-30505541d877)
His TensorFlow project is available online at: https://github.com/sebastianheinz/stockprediction

I downloaded his data for the period from April to July 2017
including 500 stocks and S&P500 index with 1 minute interval.
Then I constructed a model on PyTorch
